## Welcome to Our GitHub Repository
This repository is created to showcase our hotel booking system. Below are the features that we have implemented in this project:

User Registration and Login: Users can create an account and login to access the hotel booking system. Once logged in, users can search for available rooms, make reservations, and manage their bookings.

Payment Gateway: We have integrated a payment gateway to facilitate secure and seamless transactions. You can use the dummy card details provided below for testing purposes:

Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242</br>
Expiry: 12/23</br>
CVV: 123</br>
Admin Functionality: Admin users can log in to access the admin panel where they can add new rooms to the hotel. This feature ensures that the hotel management can keep the availability of the rooms up-to-date.

We hope you find our hotel booking system useful. Please feel free to provide us with feedback and suggestions for improvement. Thank you for visiting our repository!
